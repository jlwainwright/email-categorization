# Explain Panels

## Chart
- Candlesticks show price moves over time (Green = up, Red = down).
- Volume shows trading activity. High volume makes moves more meaningful.
- Start simple: add indicators only when you know why you need them.

## Order Ticket
- Limit order controls the price you pay/receive but may not fill.
- Market order fills now at the current price (can vary in fast markets).
- Use a Stop‑Loss to cap potential loss; Take Profit to lock gains.

## P&L
- Unrealized P&L changes as price moves. Realized P&L is locked after closing.
- Fees, spread, and slippage affect your results.
- Manage risk first—profits follow disciplined risk control.
