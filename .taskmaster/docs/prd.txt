# AI-Powered Email Categorization System

## Overview
An intelligent email categorization system that automatically sorts incoming emails into predefined folders using advanced AI sentiment analysis and content categorization. The system integrates with IMAP email servers (primarily Gmail) and leverages HuggingFace's DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for sophisticated email categorization. This solution eliminates manual email sorting, reduces inbox clutter, and improves email management efficiency for both personal and business users.
